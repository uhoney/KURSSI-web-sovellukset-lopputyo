			<h3>What is this?</h3>
			<p>This prototype game was created as a part of a course on basic frontend web development. The goal was to
				use
				HTML/CSS/JS to create a site with certain conditions like using an API.</p>
			<h3>What is the game?</h3>
			<p>The player is shown a random movie poster and has to guess the release year. Yes, quite basic.. but still
				challenging to program with basically zero experience in HTML/CSS/JS. The game utilizes TMDB (The movie
				database) in its queries.</p>
			<h3>How to play?</h3>
			<p>Quite simple; You just guess a year as four digits and hit enter! There is no mouse input on submit,
				because I felt it was clumsy.. It's just way faster to use keypad and enter to shoot answers, even on a
				TKL.
				Stats are stored on browsers localStorage.</p>
			<h3>Game is not loading..</h3>
			<p>Read the README.md on github. Link is in the footer of this page. But here goes anyway;</p>
			<p>1. Make sure you wrote your API-key inside apikey.txt on a single line</p>
			<p>2. Check browser log for error messages.</p>
			<p>Even with over a million entries on TMDB, it is NOT quaranteed, that an ID is populated. Therefore some
				of
				the queries will return empty. Also not every movie has a poster or is suitable for this game (no adult
				content). This means load times may be instant or seriously long waits.. You can check the browser log
				to
				see what is happening. It SHOULD hide the input field and show it only when conditions are met.</p>

			<p><span id="warning">Be warned though.. even if the game is supposed to have no adult content, some
					adult entries bleed
					through even when marked as non-adult! I have no control over these incorrect database
					entries.</span>
			</p>
			<h3>Other non-useful stuff</h3>
			<p>This was a school project, so time invested in this was limited as we have to submit our work on time.
				One
				resilient bug is still present, I did not successfully catch that. The game can get tangled on occasion,
				maybe on async function or something related. You can just F5 for refresh.</p>
			<p>I like clear minimalistic interfaces. So, I didn't use center on everything and kept css-magic to a
				minimum. You could argue that the poster should be centered, but that is just an opinion. I didn't like
				the way it looked, so I kept it default left.</p>
